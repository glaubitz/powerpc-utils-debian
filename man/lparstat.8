.TH LPARSTAT 8 2011-05-01 Linux "Linux on Power Service Tools"
.SH NAME
lparstat \- Reports logical partition ( LPAR ) related information and statistics.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/sbin/lparstat [ options ]
.HP
.B /usr/sbin/lparstat <interval> [ count ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIlparstat\fR command provides a report of LPAR related information and utilization statistics. This command provides a display of current LPAR related parameters and Hypervisor information, as well as utilization statistics for the LPAR.

The \fIlparstat\fR command with no options will generate a single report containing utilization statistics related to the LPAR since boot time.

The following information is displayed in the system configuration row:
.TP
type
Partition Type. Can be either dedicated or shared.
.TP
mode
Indicates whether the partition processor capacity is capped or uncapped allowing it to consume idle cycles from the shared pool. Dedicated LPAR is capped or donating.
.TP
smt
Indicates whether simultaneous multi-threading is enabled or disabled in the partition. If SMT is enabled, the number of SMT threads is displayed.
.TP
lcpu
Number of online logical processors.
.TP
mem
Online Memory Capacity.
.TP
cpus
Number of online physical processors in the pool.
.RS
This attribute is referred as
.B psize
in legacy mode and only available in shared LPAR environment.
.RE
.TP
ent
Entitled processing capacity in processor units. This information is displayed only if the partition type is shared.
.P
The following information is displayed in the utilization row:
.TP
%user
Shows the percentage of the entitled processing capacity used while executing at the user level (application).
For dedicated partitions, the entitled processing capacity is the number of physical processors.
For uncapped partitions with a current physical processor consumption above their entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (physc).
.TP
%sys
Shows the percentage of the entitled processing capacity used while executing at the system level (kernel).
For dedicated partitions, the entitled processing capacity is the number of physical processors.
For uncapped partitions with a current physical processor consumption above their entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (physc).
.TP
%wait
Shows the percentage of the entitled processing capacity unused while the partition was idle and had outstanding disk I/O requests.
For dedicated partitions, the entitled processing capacity is the number of physical processors.
For uncapped partitions with a current physical processor consumption above their entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (physc).
.TP
%idle
Shows the percentage of the entitled processing capacity unused while the partition was idle and did not have any outstanding disk I/O request.
For dedicated partitions, the entitled processing capacity is the number of physical processors.
For uncapped partitions with a current physical processor consumption above their entitled capacity, the percentage becomes relative to the number of physical processor consumed (physc).
.P
The following statistics are displayed when the partition type is shared or dedicated-donating:
.TP
physc
Shows the number of physical processors consumed.
.TP
vcsw
Shows the number of virtual context switches that are virtual processor hardware preemptions.
.P
The following statistics are displayed only when the partition type is shared:
.TP
%entc
Shows the percentage of the entitled capacity consumed. Because the time base over which this data is computed can vary, the entitled capacity percentage can sometimes exceed 100%. This excess is noticeable only with small sampling intervals.
.TP
lbusy
Shows the percentage of logical processor(s) utilization that occurred while executing at the user and system level.
.TP
app
Shows the available physical processors in the shared pool.
.TP
phint
Shows the number of phantom (targeted to another shared partition in this pool) interruptions received.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
Lists details on the LPAR configuration. The various details displayed by the -i option are listed below:
.RS
.TP
Node Name
Description
.TP
Partition Name
Logical partition name as assigned at the HMC.
.TP
Partition Number
Number of this Logical Partition.
.TP
Type
Indicates whether the LPAR is using dedicated or shared CPU resource and if the SMT is turned ON. The Type is displayed in the format [Shared | Dedicated] [ -SMT ] [ -# ]
The following list explains the different Type formats:
.RS
.TP
Shared - Indicates that the LPAR is running in the Shared processor mode.
.TP
Dedicated - Indicates that the LPAR is running in the dedicated processor mode.
.TP
SMT[-#] - Indicates that the LPAR has SMT mode turned ON and the number of SMT threads is 2. If the number of threads is greater than 2, then the number of threads is also displayed.
.RE
.TP
Mode
Indicates whether the LPAR processor capacity is capped, or if it is uncapped and allowed to consume idle cycles from the shared pool. Dedicated LPAR is capped or donating.
.TP
Entitled Capacity
    The number of processing units this LPAR is entitled to receive.
.TP
Partition Group-ID
    LPAR group that this LPAR is a member of.
.TP
Shared Pool ID
    Identifier of Shared Pool of Physical processors that this LPAR is a member.
.TP
Online Virtual CPUs
Number of CPUs (virtual engines) currently online.
.TP
Maximum Virtual CPUs
Maximum possible number of CPUs (virtual engines).
.TP
Minimum Virtual CPUs
    Minimum number of virtual CPUs this LPAR was defined to ever have.
.TP
Online Memory
Amount of memory currently online.
.TP
Minimum Memory
    Minimum memory this LPAR was defined to ever have.
.TP
Desired Memory
    Indicates the desired amount of memory.
.TP
Maximum Memory
    Maximum possible amount of memory.
.TP
Variable Capacity Weight
    The priority weight assigned to this LPAR which controls how extra (idle) capacity is allocated to it. A weight of -1 indicates a soft cap is in place.
.TP
Minimum Capacity
    The minimum number of processing units this LPAR was defined to ever have. Entitled capacity can be reduced down to this value.
.TP

    The maximum number of processing units this LPAR was defined to ever have. Entitled capacity can be increased up to this value.
