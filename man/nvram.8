.SH NAME
nvram \- format data stored in non-volatile RAM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/sbin/nvram
[ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nvram
is used to print and modify data stored in the non-volatile RAM (NVRAM)
on a PowerPC-64 system.  NVRAM on these systems is partitioned into data
sections that each have their own format.  The print options to this
command selects what to print and how to format it.

.P
The
.I nvram 
utility can also be used to update the data in certain NVRAM partitions of
PowerPC-64 systems.
.I Nvram
can update the value of a name/value pair for NVRAM partitions formatted
as a set of name=value pairs.  On many systems, the following NVRAM
partitions contain data formatted as name=value pairs: common, of-config,
and ibm,setupcfg.
