    ppc64_cpu: Add support to parse PAPR information for energy and frequency
    
    H_GET_EM_PARMS H_CALL was previously responsible for exporting energy,
    frequency related information in the "/proc/ppc64/lparcfg", when the
    --frequency option was invoked, however the H_GET_EM_PARMS H_CALL will
    be deprecated P10 onwards.
    The information within lparcfg was encoded and was needed to be parsed
    in order to extract the state.
    
    The new "H_GET_ENERGY_SCALE_INFO" H_CALL has the ability to export
    information in plain-text and userspace programs can simply parse this
    from a sysfs interface, with just the knowledge of the ids of the
    attributes and without the need for interpretation of the values.
    
    The new interface exports information as follows:
    /sys/firmware/papr/energy_scale_info/
       |-- <id>/
         |-- desc
         |-- value
         |-- value_desc (if exists)
       |-- <id>/
         |-- desc
         |-- value
         |-- value_desc (if exists)
    
    The commit adds capability to parse this information from the new
    interface and in case of faliure it rolls back to the lparcfg parse to
    report this information.
    The frequency information computation has been kept intact and a the
    frequencies reported from the platform is displayed in a different
    header.
    
    Sample output from the powerpc-utils tool is as follows:
    
    Power and Performance Mode: XXXX
    Idle Power Saver Status   : XXXX
    Processor Folding Status  : XXXX --> Printed if Idle power save status is supported
    
    Platform reported frequencies --> Frequencies reported from the platform's H_CALL i.e PAPR interface
    min        :    NNNN GHz
    max        :    NNNN GHz
    static     :    NNNN GHz
    
    Tool Computed frequencies
    min        :    NNNN GHz (cpu XX)
    max        :    NNNN GHz (cpu XX)
    avg        :    NNNN GHz

    ppc64_cpu: Variable maybe unitilized at the time of return
    
    Variable "rc" maybe unitilized, as rc's value is assigned within a loop
    with no guarantee the loop will execute and can return undefined values.
    
    Therefore, fix the bug by initializing the return code to zero.

    drmgr: Add support for 'acc' command
    
    Using HMC interface, the user can change the quality of service
    credits (QoS) dynamically for NX GZIP accelerator. This interface
    invokes drmgr command which writes the new QoS credit value to
    sysfs file. So to support NX accelerator, 'acc' command is
    introduced and the drmgr is executed with following arguments.
    
    drmgr -c acc -t <accelType> -q <qos_count> -w <timeout> -d <detail level>
    
      accelType: Only GZIP accelerator type is supported now
      qos_count: New total QoS credits

    hcnmgr: Support wicked HNV using new wicked functions for bonding
    
    first: Add wicked support hnv command functions
    
    second: fixed offline remove HNV
    
    Added scanhcn_wicked() to be able to reconfigure HNV at the end of scan.
    When lpar has been shut down, and an old HNV can be removed, the virtual
    device can be added to a new HNV,  the configration
    changes then. This requires to reconfigure all bonds.
    
    third: udev renaming racing with hcncfg and wicked ifup, here we improved
    wicked cfghcn function by always waiting for udev events complete before
    search for device to get the device-ready device names
    
    last: post LPM migration the new sr_iov should be set as primary, it
    currently calling wicked ifup after the ifcfg file modified to make the
    sr_iov as primary device. However the kernel is not noticed, we added a
    workaround here to directly update via sysfs

    ci: add GitHub Actions build tests
    
    GitHub's hosted x86 Ubuntu runners have cross toolchains suitable for
    building powerpc-utils and its various library dependencies (librtas,
    zlib, and libnuma) for its targeted architectures. Add a matrix build
    including these (32- and 64-bit big-endian, 64-bit little-endian) powerpc
    platforms which perform a basic build and distcheck.
    
    Also perform a native x86 build since it "works": it produces nothing you
    would want to run, but the build succeeds. If we are to add tests in the
    future, running them as native code on the build host may be the best
    option. So it's in our interest to keep the x86 build working.

    firmware on machines with such capable slots.
    
    DRC-TYPE        Description
    45      A U.2 PCI Express Rev 4 4x lane slot with 2x lanes connected
    46      A PCI Express Rev 5 8x lane slot with 1 lane connected
    47      A PCI Express Rev 5 8x lane slot with 4x lanes connected
    48      A PCI Express Rev 5 8x lane slot with 8x lanes connected
    49      A PCI Express Rev 5 16x lane slot with 1 lane connected
    50      A PCI Express Rev 5 16x lane slot with 4x lanes connected
    51      A PCI Express Rev 5 16x lane slot with 8x lanes connected

    errinjct: sanitize devspec output of a newline if one is present
    
    Linux Kernel Commit: 14c19b2a40b6 ("PCI/sysfs: Add 'devspec' newline")
    introduced a newline character at the end of the devspec result which
    historically did not have one before. When a newline is present the
    errinjct utility constructs an invalid pathname for a PCI devices /reg
    property in the device tree. As a result the tool fails to provide a
    valid config address to RTAS resulting in a (-3) Parameter Error.

    lsdevinfo: optimize criteria filtering
    
    lsdevinfo is significantly slower when a criteria filter is set with the
    -q flag.
    
    There are two culprits:
    
    1. The criteria string given on the command line is parsed every time
       we call check_criteria().  We're forking two sed(1) processes whenever
       we hit that function.  We hit it a lot.
    
    2. Criteria checking runs in constant time.  We call check_criteria() and
       do the parsing in (1) for every relevant attribute, even if we already
       have a match from a prior check_criteria() invocation.
    
    We can fix issue (1) by parsing the criteria string once at the start
    of the script.  I have added a function, parse_criteria(), that parses
    the $criteria string and selects an appropriate matching function.
    
    This approach also fixes problem (2), but we first need to check
    whether the user's criteria is relevant to the attributes the script
    cares about before calling the matching function.  We do this with
    criteria_is_relevant().
    
    The speed improvement is nice.  Consider my test machine with around
    thirty devices.  On this machine, lsdevinfo without any options runs
    in 1.35s, but with the "status=1" criteria it runs in 2.12s:
    
    $ /usr/sbin/lsdevinfo | fgrep -c device:
    29
    $ command time -p /usr/sbin/lsdevinfo > /dev/null
    real 1.35
    user 1.42
    sys 0.16
    $ command time -p /usr/sbin/lsdevinfo -q status=1 > /dev/null
    real 2.12
    user 2.22
    sys 0.30
    
    With this patch, lsdevinfo with the "status=1" criteria now runs in
    1.35s:
    
    $ command time -p /usr/sbin/lsdevinfo -q status=1 > /dev/null
    real 1.35
    user 1.41
    sys 0.18
    
    This patch eliminates nearly all of the criteria-checking overhead in
    the current code.

    Introducing lparnumascore
    
    This command is computing the LPAR NUMA score for CPU and memory.
    
    After a LPM, resources like CPU and memory could be reassigned to a
    different NUMA node. But the Linux kernel is not able to replicate these
    changes and since the kernel commit bb7c3d36e3b1 ("powerpc/pseries: remove
    prrn special case from DT update path"), PRRN event are only updating the
    device tree, but not the resource's assignement the kernel is managing.
    
    This new command detects CPU and memory resources the kernel keep binded to
    the NUMA node topology of the departure node. It computes a ratio, and
    print it to the standard output.
    
    The ratio is between 0 (worst) and 100 (best).
    
    For instance when half of the CPUs have been reassigned to a new NUMA node,
    the score would be 50. If all the CPUs are on the right node, the score
    would be 100.
    
    The command can compute the CPU and memory score or only one if specified
    through the -c option.
    
    Example of output:
    $ ./lparnumascore -h
    Usage: lparnumascore [-d detail_level] [-c {mem | cpu}]
    
    $ ./lparnumascore
    CPU score: 80
    MEM score: 45
    
    $ ./lparnumascore -c mem
    MEM score: 45
    
    $ ./lparnumascore -c cpu
    CPU score: 80
    
    The command is not locking /var/lock/dr_config_lock so user should ensure
    that there is not ongoing command impacting the computed scores. This
    allows the command to be run without special privileges.

    drmgr: rename is_lsslot_cmd into read_dynamic_memory_v2
    
    is_lsslot_cmd is used to decide if ibm,dynamic-memory-v2 should be read or
    not.
    
    Rename it as read_dynamic_memory_v2 so it would be used by command other
    than lsslot.

    drmgr: fix remove by index operation
    
    The commit e9f06531356f ("drmgr: introduce NUMA based LMB removal")
    introduce a special processing when NUMA is on and the remove by count
    operation is done.
    
    Unfortunately, that code is also triggered when doing a remove by index
    operation (-s argument) becauses usr_drc_count is set to 1. As a
    consequence the index constraint is not respected and any LMB can be
    removed.
    
    Add a check agains usr_drc_index which is set when a remove by index
    operation is done to ensure the numa removal code is not triggered in that
    case.

    drmgr: introduce NUMA based LMB removal
    
    When the NUMA topology can be read, all the LMBs found in the Device Tree
    are linked the corresponding node. LMB not associated to node are
    considered as not used.
    
    LMB associated to CPU less node are accounted separately because they will
    be targeted first to be remove. The LMB are removed from the CPU less nodes
    to reach an average number LMBs per CPU less node.
    
    Node with CPU have a ration indexed on their number of CPUs. The higher a
    node have CPU the lower number LMB will be removed. This way node with a
    high number of CPU will get a higher amount of memory.
    
    When a LMB can't be removed (because its memory can't be offlined by the
    kernel), the LMB count for node is decremented and the LMB is removed from
    the node's LMB list. This way, it is no more accounted as 'active' and the
    removal operation will continue without taking it in account anymore.
    
    The removal is done through the remove by DRC index API, allowing to remove
    a LMB at a time. One futur optimization would be to extend that API to
    remove a linear range of LMB each time.
    
    When the requested amount of LMB could not be removed a partial status is
    reported. This is a major difference since currently the kernel is adding back
    again the removed LMBs in case the requested amount to remove cannot be reached.
    That's odd and reporting a partial status is better when user want to remove as
    much as memory as possible.
    
    If the NUMA topology can't be read, we fallback using the legacy remove
    way.

    hcnmgr: Fix ofpathname race with udev rename
    
    When hcncfgdrc is called to configure an sr-iov or a backend vdevice, drmgr
    has already returned from DR add. However sometimes the two commands happens too
    fast that the OS has not completed its work to get the device ready. There is
    still a small race window between udev rename and ofpathname lookup. This leads
    to ofpathname grabbing a stale devname as a result of udev renaming a device to
    something else. This causes hcncfgdrc failure to enslave the sr-iov or backend
    vdevice silently, and later causes Live Parition Migration failure due to
    missing backend slave for primary sr-iov device
    
    Fix by catching the failure of enslave vdevice at the time of calling
    do_config_vdevice to enslave the device, and in the case of failure wait for
    udev settle to complete udev events before repeating enslave attempt.

    ofpathname: Use NVMe controller physical nsid
    
    Linux creates logical block devices of the the form nvmeXnYpZ such that X = the
    controller, Y = namepsace, and Z = partition. For example:
    
    /dev/nvme0n1p1
    
    The Linux namespace numbering scheme for namespaces always starts at 1 and
    increases monotonically regardless of the actual numbering scheme of the
    namespaces as seen by the  physical NVMe controller. Accordingly, the Open
    firmware path binding utilizes the namespace id as seen by the controller and
    not the necessarily the one given in the logical block device name.
    
    As such we need to use the "nsid" attribute in the sysfs entry for the logical
    device to properly map back and forth from OP pathnames.

    Clean up dead network config interface after inactive migration
    
    With inactive parition migration, we found there are
    dead network interface asscoiated with the SR_IOV from
    source LPAR that still exist.
    
    We need to cleanup the old network interface
    related to this devname from source LPAR. Normally
    in the active parition migration case, this was done
    when HMC issue commands to OS remove the
    VF from hybrid network. Because of the inactive
    migration, the OS was not notified before migration
    that the VF was removed, thus leaves the dead network
    interface belongs on the original MVF on source lpar
    not cleaned up. This cause the confusion of the network
    manager to bring up the bondings with new MVFs at destination
    LPAR.
    
    After inactive parition migration the same devname
    could possiblily used at the destination LPAR.
    It can be assigned to a different hybrid
    network (different hcnid). At the OS boot time,
    the same devname but with different hcnid will
    be configured. However the old network work interface
    associated with the same devname from the source LPAR
    has not been cleaned up yet.
    
    This patch fix this by during the boot time scan and
    if found an VFs has more than two bonding interfaces,
    or has old VF ifcfg, removed the expired one.

    HNV fixes for qrydev and remove lsdevinfo
    
    This patch fixes a few issues found during testing:
    
    1) Fix qrydev checking for active interface error
    
    2) Skip collecting lsdevinfo right before migration
    When the LPARs has large number of devices, this can
    take quite a long time and flood the log message.
    
    3) Wait for OS ready to lookup device name for configure
    HNV device. We need give OS longer time to prepare pci
    device after DLPAR to show up for ofpathname(). We have
    run into several issues HNV issues the hcncfgdrc command
    to configure the vdevices before ofpathname able
    to find the device name yet.
    
    4) Currently the hybrid network virtualization is only
    supported on PowerVM LPAR. We should allow exit the hcnmgr
    gracefully on other power platform instead of return error.

    Do not use automatic method (DHCP, PPP, etc) when bond interface is setup
    
     When creating bond, by default the ipv4.method is auto, set to dhcp
     In the case of mutiple HNV interfaces, this can case bond interfaces deactive and
     active again and again.
    
     So here Set default ipv4 method to disable. Bond is created without IP .
    
     User can configure static IP manually with
     nmcli con mod id <bond-name> ipv4.method manual ipv4.address 192.168.2.203/24
    
    As long as each interface is on a different network, then they should be able to
    all use dhcp, but the dhcp server would need to support all these different
    networks and hand out ips on the different subnets

    drmgr: query in-kernel dlpar support by DRC connector type
    
    Support to initiate kernel facilitated dlpar for CPU and MEM was
    introduced into drmgr back in 2016 with commit bbc5fc0 however, this
    proved problematic for CPU as most distros didn't have in kernel CPU
    dlpar support yet. As a result CPU support was disabled with commit
    a97c566.
    
    The main issue is that drmgr blindly tests for the existence of
    /sys/kernel/dlpar to identify in kernel dlpar support. This test doesn't
    reveal if support goes beyond MEM and includes CPU. This further
    complicates adding new connector types such as PHB, PCI, and SLOT down
    the road, and backwards compatability of newer drmgr on older kernels.
    
    The /sys/kernel/dlpar attribute was extended by the following kernel
    commit torvalds/linux@673bc43 that introduced a comma separated list of
    device support.
    
    Update drmgr utility to use this mechanism to determine which
    device/connector/drc_types are supported by in kernel dlpar.
    
    1.) For the case where /sys/kernel/dlpar does not exist use legacy dlpar
    facilities.
    
    2.) For the case where /sys/kernel/dlpar exists but does not
    reading we assume only memory support for in kernel and use legacy
    all other types.
    
    3.) For the case where /sys/kernel/dlpar exists and is readable we parse
    the returned list for supported devices and fall back to legacy
    facilities for anything not in the list.

    Support inactive migration with migratable SR_IOV
    
    HMC supports adding migratable sr-iov when LPAR is inactive.
    This allows inactive LPAR migrates with SR_IOV VFs. HMC will
    generate unique HCNID and PHYP the migratable sr-iov device
    and it's backup virtual device vnic or veth with same ibm
    property ibm,hcn-id. This is done while the partion is inactive.
    
    When LPAR backs online, the OS is responsible to find out the
    new migritable SR_IOV configured during LPAR was inactive. This
    makes the new SR_IOV added eligible for migration, or able to
    re-configure SR_IOV with HCN post migration.
    
    Added function in hcnmgr to scan the device-tree, find
    migratable SR_IOV that has no hybrid network being configured,
    setting up the active-back bonding with backup matching vnic or
    veth. Add new SR_IOV and its backing devices as slave. Skip the HCN

    Tools to support migrtable SR_IOV hybrid virtual network
    
    A LPAR that utilizes an SR-IOV logical port (physical device) cannot be
    migrated. To allow SR_IOV eligiable for live partition migration, HMC can
    configures a virtual device (virtual ethernet or virtual NIC) as a backup
    for each SR-IOV logical port and performs failover network operations to
    the virtual device before migration. After migration, then performs
    failover network operations again to the SR-IOV logical ports.
    
    When HMC configure an migratiable SR_IOV device, the hypervisor will set
    unique hybrid network ID (HCN ID) propterty for the SR_IOV and backup
    virtual device. And instruct Guest OS to configre hybrid network.
    Guest OS will able to recoganize them and configure hybrid
    network. This patch introduces new commands from HMC to linux to configure an
    active-backup bonding with the SR-IOV logical port as the primary device and
    a virtual device such as a virtual Ethernet device or vNIC device as the
    backup device.
    
    hcncfrdrc -- configure migratable SR_IOV hybrid virtual network (HCN) before
                    or right after migration
    hcnqrydev -- pre-migration, query SR_IOV device has active backup virtual device
    hcnrmdev -- remove migritable SR_IOV device from HCN right before migration
    hcnrmhcn -- clean up hybrid virtual network when remove migratable SR_IOV
    hcnversion -- returns current HCN support version back to HMC

    ofpathname: make goto_dir canonicalize directory argument
    
    Commit c97fe35b5b6d "ofpathname: speed up l2of_scsi()" attempted to
    optimize the look up of scsi devices by restricting the base directory
    input of the 'find' command to /sys/class/block instead of /sys. This
    works as intended for raw scsi disks such as sda, but broke for scsi disk
    partitions such as sda1.
    
    (0) root @ linux-td1r: /root/powerpc-utils
    $ ./scripts/ofpathname /dev/sda1
    : Logical device "/dev/sda1" does not appear

    /vdevice/v-scsi@30000066/disk@8100000000000000
    
    The differences in looking up sda1 via /sys/class/block vs /sys:
    
    (0) root @ linux-td1r: /root/powerpc-utils
    $ find /sys/class/block -name sda1

    /sys/class/block/sda1
    
    In the end /sys/class/block/sda1 is just a symlink to sda1 under /sys/devices/vio/...

    However, ofpathname assumes that by moving up to the parent we will
    eventually find the raw disk device, in the above example sda,  and this
    will only happen for paths under /sys/devices in the case of scsi disk
    partitions.
    
    Fix this regression by using readlink in goto_dir() to canonicalize the
    path name of the device while following all symlinks.

    The default switch section of get_command() is meant to catch defined
    connector types that currently have no support. However, the error
    messages passes usr_drc_type (an integral value) to a %s conversion
    modifier resulting in a bad address dereference.
    
    Fix up to use a %d conversion modifier instead.

    add option --disable-werror to configure
    
    Commit a6929691fd25 ("treat compiler warnings as errors") imposed
    -Werror unconditionally in Makefile.am, in order to prevent the
    addition of new warnings to the build. While it's important to keep
    the project reasonably warning-clean, it's also necessary to provide
    downstream packagers and users in a variety of environments more
    flexibility in this area.
    
    Keep -Werror by default but make it configurable. The user may specify
    --disable-werror at configure time to prevent compiler warnings from
    halting the build. This is a reasonably common way to deal with
    this (examples include glibc, gdb, json-c).

    drmgr/common_ofdt: correct stringop-truncation warning

    serv_config: use correct length for system parameter string data
    
    "val" here is a character string; sizeof(val) yields the size of the
    pointer. The ibm,set-system-parameter call expects the prepended
    length field to reflect the string length including the terminating
    NUL byte.

    define _GNU_SOURCE project-wide
    
    This project uses several nonstandard GNU-specific extensions which
    are exposed only when _GNU_SOURCE is defined.  Examples include
    CPU_SET(3) and related APIs by necessity and asprintf(3) for
    convenience.
    
    Currently _GNU_SOURCE is used in a piecemeal fashion, meaning you have
    to add it to the source file when you introduce a use of asprintf, for
    example. Also, note that it is used incorrectly in a couple of places:
    it must appear before any headers are included for it to work reliably.
    
    There's not much justification for the code duplication and lack of
    uniformity here. Put '-D _GNU_SOURCE' in AM_CPPFLAGS for a more
    consistent experience across the project's C code.
    
    This will cause all C code to be built with _GNU_SOURCE.

    dispatch, as well as relative to the vcpu's home node/chip as indicated
    by the Power hypervisor.
    
    'vcpustat' enables monitoring this statistic at customizable intervals.
    By default, the statistics are presented as a percentage of the total
    dispatches in each monitoring interval. In addition, '-n' option can be
    used to display numeric values, while '-r' allows displaying the raw

    powerpc-utils: Suppress errors reading kernel files
    
    A problem was observed with the evaluation of the '${devspec} by
    the script 'ofpathname'.  The problem occurred during installation
    to an nvme device as follows:
    
    02:29:41,669 INF program: Running... ofpathname /dev/nvme0n1p1
    02:29:41,922 INF program: /sbin/ofpathname: line 684: warning: command substitution: ignored null byte in input
    
    Detailed examination showed that instances of the device-tree
    property "/namespace/name" within one or more of the PCI devices
    contained null bytes which were echoed along with the value e.g.
    
    [root device-tree]# cat /proc/device-tree/pci@800000020000029/pci1014,637@0/namespace/name | hexdump -C
    00000000  6e 61 6d 65 73 70 61 63  65 00                    |namespace.|
    0000000a
    [root device-tree]#
    
    This patch provides improves handling of errors within that script,
    and by some of the follow-on uses of the tool by the 'bootlist' script.
    
    * Deal with error messages returned sometimes by evaluation
      of ${devspec} in 'ofpathname'.
    * Strip embedded nulls from values provided by kernel files.
    * Redirect more error messages to /dev/null

    Safe bootlist update
    
    This patch is intended to prevent problems with identifying or parsing
    the bootlist devices from propagating into the system NVRAM configuration.
    A number of such problems have been observed when processing USB devices.
    
    * If 'bootlist' encounters an invalid OF_DEVPATH entry, it will print
      an notice, but still continue on to write invalid data to nvram.
    
      Changed to abort the script before writing bad data to nvram.
    
    * When 'ofpathname' encounters an invalid 'devspec' file or invalid
      value in a 'devspec' file, while trying to find the logical pathname
      for a scsi device, it may continue to return the invalid 'devspec'
      value to the caller/invoking script.
    
      Changed to abort with an error message instead of returning that
      invalid value to a caller like 'bootlist'.
    
      Example:
      # bootlist -m normal sdb
      # bootlist -m normal -o
      Could not translate (null)/scsi@0/sd@0,0 to logical device name

    lparstat: add an option to print the lparstat report similar to legacy lparstat tool
    
    This patch adds a new command line option (-l, --legacy) to allow
    users to print the report similar to legacy lprastat tool without
    affecting existing report format.
    
    Changes done to make the current report format similar to legacy
    report format are listed below:
    
    1) The memory attribute will be printed in MB instead of KB.
    2) cpus attribute will be referred as psize in legacy report format
       and only printed in shared lpar environment.
    3) On legacy lparstat tool the lcpu attribute is a combination of
       two attributes, smt and number of online processor. Formula used
       to calculate the lcpu is given below.
                  lcpu = smt * number of online processors

    scripts: Improve handling of errors from subsidiary scripts
    
    This patch is to fix the handling of errors by 'lsdevinfo' from
    invocations of 'ofpathname' that also encounter errors.  Error
    messages from 'ofpathname' were being sent through 'stdout', and
    interpreted as valid data by a number of script instructions in
    'lsdevinfo'.  Following is an example of such a failure when the
    error results were forwarded to an associated HMC.

    lparstat: correct calculation of physc to use tbr
    
    Currently phsyc is calculated using the sampled PURR values from lparcfg and
    a derived timebase that lparstat itself calculates. However, both the Timer
    Facilities section in Book III of the ISA and PAPR outline that this resource
    calcuation is done by computing the ratio of the PURR delta and the Timebase
    Register delta for the sampled period.
    
    I've sent a patch upstream to the kernel list to also export the Timebase
    Register (tbr) in /proc/ppc64/lparcfg [1]. Use this value for calculating
    physc value when running on a kernel that exposes tbr.

    The patch limits the number of threads used for CPU frequency calculation
    to the minimum of either the actual number of CPUs in the system or
    CPU_SETSIZE(currently 1024). In other words, if the number of CPUs in the
    system is less than CPU_SETSIZE, a thread is created for each of the CPUs,
    otherwise only CPU_SETSIZE threads are created. This is being done because
    sched_setaffinity() will only work on CPU_SETSIZE CPUs, anything over the
    limit is not supported.

    lsslot: add DRC Type description strings for new U.2 PCIe slots
    
    Two new PCI slot types can be reported from firmware in the DRC Type
    property for a PCI device. The following are the slot descriptions for
    DRC types 43 and 44.
    
    43	A U.2 PCI Express Rev 3 4x lane slot with 4x lanes connected
    44	A U.2 PCI Express Rev 4 4x lane slot with 4x lanes connected
    
    Currently, the lsslot utility reports "Unknown" for the description of
    these pci devices. Update the php_slot_type_msg[] with these new slot
    descriptions so that lsslot correctly reports them.

    lsslot: Remove extra call to free_lmbs in failure cases
    
    This reverts commit e6f476d32c33f5b8e364f930c467785495eeb0ce.
    
     From my inspection, get_lmbs frees the lmb_list correctly in all failure
    cases. The extra call to free_lmbs will cause the lmb_list to be freed
    twice. I think it's likely that the original coverity issue that this was
    meant to address was a false positive. Reverting the change has been seen
    to resolve a seg fault.

    Test for librtas/librtasevent headers and libraries
    
    The current configure script only tests for the presence of librtas.h. Certain
    distros have chosen to split the librtas package into seperate librtas and
    librtasevent library/development packages. As a result compilation will fail
    for the rtas_event_decode utility if librtasevent.h is missing.
    
    Fix this by also checking for librtasevent.h, and for sanity purposes that
    the libraries themselves are actually present and linkable.

    lparstat: Fix parsing of /proc/interrupts SPU line
    
    The current means of parsing the SPU line in /proc/interrupts is incorrect.
    Adding 11 to the current pointer is only correct if the number of SPU
    interrupts in each column is a single digit. Otherwise, for values with
    more than a single digit, we will only see the last digit of the value.
    This patch fixes the issue by using strstr to check for the SPU line and

    ppc64_cpu: Scale CPU cycles counter by amount of time it ran
    
    At the moment we start a CPU cycles counter, sleep one second and
    read the counter value, assuming we got one second of time on the
    PMU.
    
    There are two issues with this. If someone else is consuming all
    the available PMCs, we may end up context switching the PMC and
    count for half (or less) of the time. In this case we report a CPU
    frequency that is half (or less) of what it should be.
    
    On the other hand if the sleep goes for longer than one second which
    might happen on a busy box, then we count for too long and report a
    CPU frequency that is too high.
    
    Also check that we got a reasonable number of cycles and report
    an error if we did not.

    lsslot: Validate DRC property groups
    
    Recently seen on a kvm guest running on a PowerNV system, the
    lsslot command segfaulted when trying to free the drc information.
    
    # gdb -q ./lsslot
    Reading symbols from ./lsslot...done.
    (gdb) run -c memory
    Starting program: ./lsslot -c memory
    
    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    free_drc_info () at src/drmgr/common_ofdt.c:287
    287			all_drc_lists = list->all_next;
    
    The root cause of this is that the DRC properties in the guest were empty.
    This caused the lsslot (and likely possible in drmgr since this code
    is common to both commands) to improperly parse the device tree
    information.
    
    To fix this we need to add a check after gathering information for
    each of the DRC properties when reading DRC property group data. If
    there are no entries in any of the DRC properties we cannot continue.

    drmgr: Stale errno usage corrections
    
    Several places in the drmgr code use a stale value of errno either
    as a return code or when printing an error message. A common example
    of this is calling the say() routine and then returning the value of
    errno. The say() routine makes several system calls and the value of
    errno after a call to say() no longer reflects the original errno
    value.
    
    Several places in the drmgr code were updated to properly handle
    the return codes from functions such as write() or open() where we
    should be checking for rc == -1 instead of rc <= 0. This does make
    a difference as errno won't be set for rc == 0.
    
    Note that partial write return codes are not really handled in the
    drmgr code. The drmgr command is writing to sysfs and /proc
    files where we know that they will either return success or
    failure and set errno, no partial writes.

    Improve perf of drmgr/lsslot with large num of virt. dev.
    
    The current algorithm for add_pci_vio_node walks the vdevice bus
    for every theoretical DRC (1000's of times).  The more vdevices
    you have populated, the worse this algorithm becomes.  On a system
    with 450 devices, this can take over 30 seconds for example.
    
    This modifies the algorithm to populate a node list of existing
    devices (so walks the tree just once), and then uses these nodes
    when populating the full list instead of walking the device tree
    for each one.
    
    NOTE:  This only is changed for virtual devices - a system with
    large numbers of PCI devices will not be optimized, but that is
    less of a concern.

    this case, update cpu_online() to treat the cpu as online.

    ofpathname : avoid duplicate entries of vFC devices
    
    Adding support to avoid the duplicate entries of a Open Firmware device path to
    logical device path for vfc-client devices.
    
    The problem can be reproduced with the bootlist command
    
    # bootlist -m normal /dev/sdd /dev/sds /dev/sdf /dev/sdv
    # bootlist -m normal -r
    /vdevice/vfc-client@30000899/disk@500507680b2255fe
    /vdevice/vfc-client@30000899/disk@500507680b2255ff
    /vdevice/vfc-client@3000089a/disk@500507680b2255fe
    /vdevice/vfc-client@3000089a/disk@500507680b2255ff
    # bootlist -m normal -o
    sda---------------->expected "sdd"
    sdp---------------->expected "sds"
    sda---------------->expected "sdf"
    sdp---------------->expected "sdv"
    
    So, this patch check the duplicate entries of logical names of vFC devices at of2l_vfc()
    and display specified bootlist :
    
    # bootlist -m normal -r
    /vdevice/vfc-client@30000899/disk@500507680b2255fe
    /vdevice/vfc-client@30000899/disk@500507680b2255ff
    /vdevice/vfc-client@3000089a/disk@500507680b2255fe
    /vdevice/vfc-client@3000089a/disk@500507680b2255ff
    # bootlist -m normal -o

    lsslot: Validate cpu->name when printing
    
    When printing the information for all possible CPUs we can possibly print
    a NULL string pointer. the libc printf code handles this gracefully by
    printing '(NULL)' but this is not what we should be relying on.
    
    This validates the cpu->name pointer before printing it and instead
    prints '--' if cpu->name is not valid.

    ppc64_cpu: emit error message for invalid core number to on- or offline
    
    An off-by-one test is done to detect invalid core numbers for explicit
    online/offline.  For example, on a 16 core system, valid cores are 0-15.
    However, specifying "16" has no effect, but does not produce an error:
    --
     # ./src/ppc64_cpu --cores-on
     Number of cores online = 15
     # ppc64_cpu --online-cores=16
     # ppc64_cpu --online-cores=17
     Invalid core to online: 17
    --
    
    This change will correctly report an error:
    --

    ppc64_cpu: add a numeric option when printing SMT
    
    Currently, there is not a numeric (non verbose) display of SMT modes,
    which means that three verbose output is usually generated, as:
    
      SMT=X
      SMT is off
      Machine is not SMT capable
    
    This patch implements a easily machine parsable output for SMT, helping
    a lot of scripts that needs to read SMT status on a machine.
    
    I am considering that if the SMT is off or impossible, then SMT=1 (1
    thread per core), thus, always returning SMT=X, where X means thread
    enabled per core, as 1, 2, 4, 8.

    If HAVE_LINUX_PERF_EVENT_H is not defined, the code fails to
    compile, because function do_cpu_frequency() does not have an
    Argument, as it has if HAVE_LINUX_PERF_EVENT_H is defined.
    This is the error message:
    
     error: too many arguments to function 'do_cpu_frequency'
    
    This patch simply adds an argument to the function.

    drmgr: Add capability for PCI hotplug only operations
    
    We need to provide the capability to do a hotplug only style of operation
    for some adapters such as nvme adapters behind a bridge that can be owned
    by more than one partition. These scenarios are used for doing failovers
    and this update reduces the total drmgr time from 18 seconds per add or
    remove down to 2-3 seconds per action.
    
    Note that this is different from the PAPR notion of hotplug where the
    device is hotplug removed from the OS, then the slot is powered down,
    a new card inserted, the slot powered up, and the device hootplug added
    back into the system. This is the drmgr -R action. This new functionality
    just does the hotplug to/from the OS, nothing else.
    
    This update assumes that when doing an add, the DR indicator already has
    the proper isolation and allocation state, and the power to the slot is
    on. For remove operations the indicator and power for the slot is not
    modified.

    lparstat: Fix bad cast from integer to float
    
    Fix a bug where the cpu stats (%user, %sys, %wait, and %idle) do not add
    up to 100%. The problem was that we were casting the cpu stats and the
    total cpu time to floats from ints. For large integer values, this would
    cause the floating point representation to be truncated. This solution
    avoids the casts and stores the cpu stats as long longs and only casts
    'total' to a long double in order to perform floating point division.
    
    Additionally, this patch parses the proc stat values as long longs as
    on systems that have been running for a long time, these values can exceed
    the maximum 32 bit integer limit.

    lparstat: Fix computation of time used in statistics
    
    The routine get_time computes bogus timestap values due to confusing
    seconds and microseconds.  This leads to incorrect return values from
    elapsed_time and therefore incorrect values for the physc field.
    
    Fixed by converting the "time" sysentry field to microseconds (and
    computing it correctly), and updating the user of elapsed_time.
    
    In addition, %entc is supposed to show the ratio of physc to the
    number of entitled CPUs as *percentage*, so the ratio needs to be
    multiplied by 100.

    drmgr: Disable use of in-kernel cpu hotplug
    
    After submitting the patch to update drmgr to use the in-kernel hotplug
    capabilities for memory and cpu, commit <bbc5fc07c54d> (drmgr: Start using
    in-kernel DLPAR functionality for cpu/memory), I realized there
    are still distro kernels that do not have the in-kernel cpu hotplug
    capabilities. Using the latest drmgr with this update breaks cpu dlpar
    because the cpu dlpar code assumes that if the dlpar sysfs file exists
    then in-kernel cpu dlpar is possible. this is wrong, the sysfs dlpar file
    was added with in-kernel memory hotplug, its existence can only guarantee
    memory hotplug capability.
    
    For now, disable using the in-kernel cpu capabilities by drmgr until
    this can be resolved.

    errinjct: Correct read_file() error checking
    
    When reading files from syfs the file length returned from a stat()
    call does not always match the actual length of the file. The read_file()
    routine should be checking for an error return from the read() call
    instead of checking that the amount read matches the file length returned
    from a stat() call.

    drmgr: Workaround for concurrent PRRN collisions
    
    Proposed workaround for issues with current PRRN event handling mechanism.
    
    Currently, the mechanism works by kicking off a script that calls a drmgr
    remove followed by a drmgr add for each effected device. With this method,
    problems can occur when multiple prrn events arrive in a short time span or
    when other dlpar operations are happening while the script is running. What
    can happen is that these other dlpar operations can jump in inbetween when
    the script calls the remove and the add and take the drmgr lock. Then when
    we try to add the memory back from the script, we are unable to take the
    drmgr lock and the add fails.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by creating a new -P flag for drmgr which will
    perform the necessary removes/adds from within the drmgr lock. The new
    option will be invoked as follows:
    
    drmgr -P <path to prrn log file>
    
    On the rtas_errd side, we will begin by creating a log file for the
    PRRN event which will contain a list of the type and the drc index for
    each effected device. Then instead of invoking the script, we will call
    the above drmgr command with the path to the prrn log file. Then, on the
    drmgr side, we parse the list and perform the necessary removes/adds and
    then delete the prrn log file.

    drmgr: Start using in-kernel DLPAR functionality for cpu/memory
    
    Now that the capability to do DLPAR of cpus and memory can be
    done completely in the kernel, update the drmgr command to use
    this functionality.
    
    The kernel updates provided a sysfs file (/sys/kernel/dlpar)
    that will allow the drmgr command invoke DLPAR of cpus and memory
    by writing to this file.
    
    There are some exisitng behaviors of drmgr on the PowerVM platforms
    that require cpu and memory to be done slightly differently. For
    memory drmgr only needs to report the number of LMBs that were
    added or removed so drmgr can just pass all requests straight to
    the kernel. This patch also makes a common routine for reporting
    memory resources to ensure the format is kept constant.
    
    For cpu DLPAR the drmgr command has to report the drc name of each
    cpu that is added/removed. To do this the command uses much of the
    same device tree parsing that is currently used and make a request
    to the kernel to remove a specific cpu (by drc index) where a
    write to the sysfs probe file was previously done.

    drmgr: avoid loading rpadlpar_io/rpaphp when -v flags is used
    
    The -v / opts->pci_virtio flag was added to provide an alternative way
    to scan/remove PCI devices which doesn't rely on rpaphp. That was a
    workaround for a bug induced by QEMU emulating PHBs with multiple
    hotpluggable slots, which fails to register slots beyond the first due
    to rpaphp no longer accounting for the possibility of there being more
    than 1 slot per PHB. This leads to warnings of the form:
    
      kernel: rpaphp: pci_hp_register failed with error -16
      kernel: rpaphp: pci_hp_register failed with error -16
      ...
    
    For most guest distros this has resulted in the module not being
    loaded by default to avoid the errors showing up.
    
    However, as of a9b4e4e, we now load automatically load the module as
    needed, but we don't take opts->pci_virtio into account when
    determining if it's needed, leading to PCI hotplug operations to
    KVM guests now resulting into rpaphp being loaded and
    generating the errors above when drmgr is invoked.
    
    Fix this by avoiding modprobe of rpadlpar_io/rpaphp when
    opts->pci_virtio is set.

    drmgr: ensure PCI cleanup is done before offlining dev
    
    As part of 4f542616, functionality was added to support add/remove
    PCI devices without relying on rpaphp hotplug module. The sysfs
    write used in the remove path initiates an asynchronous removal of
    PCI device from kernel PCI subsystem, and eventually from the sysfs
    tree. Afterward, we set the corresponding DRC for the device to
    ISOLATED state so host can complete device removal.
    
    To avoid the situation where the asychronous removal has not yet
    completed by the time drmgr sets the state to ISOLATED, and simple
    sleep of 3 seconds was added. This seems to have worked out okay
    for virtio devices, but in the case of other devices, like PCI
    passthrough of a Mellanox CX4 virtual function, the removal can take
    up to 20 seconds.
    
    When this happens, we hit a situation where the host reclaims the
    devices while the guest is still attempting to access it in it's
    cleanup path, which leads to guest crashes.
    
    Fix this by polling the PCI devices sysfs path and not completing
    the removal until the sysfs path is removed as part of device cleanup.

    drmgr: Load kernel modules for pci hotplug
    
    For PHB DLPAR, slot DLPAR, and PCI hotplug operations we need to ensure
    that the rpadlpar_io and rpaphp kernel modules are loaded or have been
    built into the kernel. A check for this is currently done for PHB and
    slot DLPAR when determining if the system is capable of these operations.
    
    This patch moves the code to validate the presence of these modules
    to be called from dr_init() for PHB/SLOT/PCI operations. In order
    to do this the parsing of args has to be done prior to calling dr_init.
    This should not cause an issue since we can parse args without holding
    the dr_lock and any errors are written to stderr.

    drmgr: Correct return code from set_mem_scn_state()
    
    The set_mem_scn_state() routine incorrectly returns the number of chars
    written in the case of success instead of returning 0. This results in the
    caller assuming a failure occurred when setting the memroy section state
    and fails the memory online/offline operation.

    drmgr: Correct LMB counting when discovering LMBs
    
    Recent updates to how drmgr counted the number of LMBs found did
    not save the count value correctly and in the case of LMBs found
    in the ibm,dynamic-reconfiguration-memory property only counted
    LMBs that were present. This caused havoc when trying to shuffle
    the LMBs.
    
    Save the LMB count in the lmb_list_head struct so we have it across
    function calls. Also update the shuffle_lmbs to just take a pointer to
    the lmb_list_head and make changes locally in the routine.

    specifying which cores to bring online or offline, respectively. Both

    ppc64_cpu: handle errors from strtol in --cores-on parsing
    
    Currently, on a 24-core system, passing certain values to `ppc64_cpu
    --cores-on` leads to some surprising results:
    
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=all
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=adfd
        offlines all but one core
    
    This is because we are not using the endptr parameter of strtol to
    determine if any of the string is consumed (and if none of the string is
    consumed, strtol still returns a valid long value, namely 0).
    
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=12df
        onlines 12 cores
    
    This is because we are not using the endptr parameter to strtol to
    determine if the entire string is consumed (checking for trailing
    characters).
    
    Add both these checks.
    
    After this patch:
    
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=all
    Invalid number of cores to online: all
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=adfd
    Invalid number of cores to online: adfd
    ppc64_cpu --cores-on=12fd
    Invalid number of cores to online: 12fd

    drmgr: free slot nodes before adding slots
    
    When handling a request for slot dlpar add the device tree is parsed twice,
    once prior to the add and again after adding the slot. On systems with a
    large number of slot devices, 200+, we are seeing that the drmgr command
    segfaults when trying to parse the device tree the second time.

    To avoid crashing here we need to free the parsed information from the
    device tree prior to adding the new slot. While this isn't really a true
    root cause fix it does alloow drmgr to run without segfaulting.

    update_flash: Add support for OpenPower system
    
    On OpenPower system we use IPMI interface to pass image to service processor
    (BMC) and it will take care of updating FW.
    
    This patch adds wrapper around ipmitool so that we can use update_flash
    command to update FW.
    
    Validation:
      BMC take care of validating image. We just pass the image to BMC.
    
    Commit/Reject operation:
      Like FSP system, BMC has two sides. Golden and boot side. Golden side
      is permanent and is never updated in the field. So commit/reject
      operations are not allowed on BMC based system.
    
    FW update:
      OpenPower system has two components (BMC FW and host FW). We send all
      the component to BMC in one command. BMC will take care of updating
      all the components.
      Note that we are not using "force" option. So BMC will skip the component
      which are not changed.
    
    FW version display:
      We display host FW version using ipmitool fru command. like below:
        Product Name          : OpenPOWER Firmware
        Product Version       : IBM-firestone-ibm-OP8_PFD_v1.6_0.29
        Product Extra         : hostboot-6847d73-b8d7c0a
        Product Extra         : occ-0726e69
        Product Extra         : skiboot-5.1.3-6221bd2
        Product Extra         : hostboot-binaries-43d5a59

    update_flash_nv: Add platform check
    
    Presently we assume this script is running on FSP based PowerNV platform.
    Lets add platform check to validate platform before running. That way
    adding new platform support (like OpenPower) becomes easy.

    update_flash_nv: Rename function name to reflect platform
    
    Presently update_flash_nv supports code update on FSP based PowerNV
    (Non-Virtualized) platform. We want to support code update on OpenPower
    (BMC based) platform. Code update procedure on OpenPower system is
    different than FSP based machine. Hence rename FSP specific function
    in this script as fsp_*.

    snap: Warn users about deprecated support for SLES 12 onwards
    
    This patch introduce deprecated warning on SLES 12 onwards
    to use supportconfig. supportconfig captures all the information
    collected by snap, so it safe to deprecate snap.
    
    It also rearranges check for distribution (RHEL/SLES/Ubuntu) into
    common function check_distro_support().
